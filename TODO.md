# TODO list

## Bugs
- cursor is sometimes invisible when refocusing
- somehow managed to create a situation where the equation looks fine, but the returned LaTeX is "\begin{align} \begin{align} \end{align} \\ \end{align}"

## Basic capabilities
- Removing the style on a symbol

## Typing improvements
- Multi-symbol selection
- Shortcuts (and buttons) for node lists
- Vertical separators in arrays
- Changes in delimiter sizes
- Possible commands to add : \substack, hdotsfor, spacings, operatorname
- Up/down cursor movement in arrays, matrices...

## Visual improvements
- Better visuals (in particular buttons), that for the moment depend on the browser
