# TODO list

## Bugs
- Bug : Rendering "error" when selecting an element in a long sequence; sometimes. Also on the title for some reason (on Chrome, but not Firefox)
- cursor is sometimes invisible when refocusing
- bug : only in the online version, the formula in the editor doesn t render as such, but as raw text

## Basic capabilities
- Removing the style on a symbol

## Typing improvements
- Changing alignement in array environments
- Multi-symbol selection
- Shortcuts (and buttons) for node lists

## Visual improvements
