# TODO list

## Bugs
- Bug : Rendering "error" when selecting an element in a long sequence; sometimes
- cursor is sometimes invisible when refocusing
- Text mode shouldn't allow deletion from inside
- When moving the cursor to the left, starting from after a fraction, it seems to skip a spot

## Basic capabilities
- Removing the style on a symbol

## Typing improvements
- Copy-pasting nodes/branches
- Changing alignement in array environments
- Up-Down cursor movements in frac
- dealing with variable-size operators similarly as fractions
- Multi-symbol selection
- Improve cursor positionning when adding a node with children (ex ²)

## Visual improvements
- Better visuals (in particular buttons), that for the moment depend on the browser
