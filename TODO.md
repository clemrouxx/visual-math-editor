# TODO list

## Bugs
- Bug : Rendering "error" when selecting an element in a long sequence; sometimes
- cursor is sometimes invisible when refocusing
- buttons allow adding special characters / commands even in text mode

## Basic capabilities
- Removing the style on a symbol

## Typing improvements
- Copy-pasting nodes/branches
- Changing alignement in array environments
- Multi-symbol selection
- Improve cursor positionning when adding a node with children (ex Â²)

## Visual improvements
- Better visuals (in particular buttons), that for the moment depend on the browser

## Code improvements
- Refactor MathTree.js (in particular use more of tree indices); to prepare for rewrite of code regarding selection
