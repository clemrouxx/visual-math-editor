# TODO list

## Bugs
- cursor is sometimes invisible when refocusing
- Ctrl-Z not working when the cursor is in text mode
- Weird bug when typing "dd[Space]"

## Basic capabilities
- Removing the style on a symbol
- Export to SVG (tried, but didn't manage to do it)

## Typing improvements
- Changing alignement in array environments
- Multi-symbol selection
- Shortcuts (and buttons) for node lists
- Allow for more than 2 fixed children (ex for \eval, \dv)

## Visual improvements
- Better visuals (in particular buttons), that for the moment depend on the browser
